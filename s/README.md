Notes Sounds
============

This directory contains all sounds played by Notes.
You may replace any or all of these with your own. 

There are two sets of sounds:

* wav files in ./
* wav files in err/

Files in ./ are sampled sounds from my poor old beach guitar.
These sound files cover all notes played by the program, and should
be named after the note names, as is done here.
Recording was performed using an iRiver IHP120 and a Sony ECM-DS70P.

Adding more files here will not cause the program to play more sounds.
To do so, you will need to edit file index.html and reference any
additional sound in there, and probably also change the notes range in code.


Files in err/ are sounds picked from free online web libraries.
Upon a wrong answer, one of these sound files is picked at random and played.


File index.html is a tentative mapping of guitar fingerings onto a computer
keyboard, and a player for testing sounds.
