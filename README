OFA's Notes
===========

Notes is web-based sight-reading learning tool for guitarists.

Notes builds on and extends ZipXap's Notably Quick Guitar, available at
http://www.readmusicfree.com/

Additions to the original:

* training notes can be selected for focused learning
* difficulty level can be selected (Basic, Medium, Advanced, Expert)
* notes sounds can be played when notes appear or disappear from the screen
* keyboard input keys can be selected (A-G or S-L)
* game can be turned into practice mode (continuous play, never loose)

Notes should work with most modern browsers, and has been tested with
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari.  Notes is slow-ish and
barely usable on iPhone 3GS.  The settings screen looks best on Chrome,
sounds play more fluidly with Chrome as well.

The original application, as deployed at readmusicfree, has a high-score
tracking system.  The tracking system relies on a server-side storage script,
which is not provided in this release.  Client-side code is still in though.

To install Notes on the web, checkout the project and upload it to your server.
Notes also works fine as a local webapp, via file:///<app_dir>/index.html

Enjoy.
